Sure, here's a transcript for a 3-minute video presentation showcasing your disaster prediction project:

[Opening Slide: Title and Introduction]
"Welcome to the Disaster Prediction System demonstration by Perfect Cube. Our project leverages advanced machine learning models to predict natural and technical disasters, providing real-time insights and response strategies."

[Slide: Project Overview]
"Our Disaster Prediction System is designed to enhance disaster preparedness and response. Using historical data and real-time inputs, the system predicts potential disasters and suggests optimal response strategies to mitigate their impact."

[Slide: Technology Stack]
"The core technologies used in this project include:
Machine Learning Models for accurate disaster predictions
    Streamlit for creating interactive web applications
    Twilio for sending real-time SMS alerts to users
    A real-time map API for displaying disaster locations visually."

[Screen Recording: Disaster Prediction Input]
"Let's start by entering some disaster details. Here, we input the location as Mysuru, select the disaster group as 'Natural,' and the disaster type as 'Flood.' We can also specify other parameters like magnitude, total deaths, number of injured, and more. Once we hit 'Predict,' the system processes this information using our trained machine learning model."

[Screen Recording: Model Results]
"Next, we move to the Model Results section. Here, you can see a preview of the data used for training and evaluation. The model's accuracy, precision, and other evaluation metrics are displayed to ensure transparency and reliability."

[Screen Recording: Disaster Management Response]
"Based on the predicted disaster type, the system suggests detailed response actions and management strategies. For instance, if a flood is predicted, it provides steps like moving to higher ground, avoiding floodwaters, and staying informed through news and weather reports."

[Screen Recording: Real-time Notifications]
"To ensure timely action, the system sends notifications to relevant authorities and emergency contacts. Here, you can see that notifications have been sent successfully, ensuring that the right people are alerted promptly."

[Screen Recording: Weather Map]
"Our Weather Map feature provides real-time weather data for specified locations. For example, here's the weather data for Mysuru, Karnataka, India, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a visual map showing the location."

[Closing Slide: Conclusion]
"In conclusion, the Disaster Prediction System by Perfect Cube is a comprehensive tool designed to predict and respond to disasters effectively. By integrating machine learning, real-time data visualization, and instant notifications, we aim to enhance disaster preparedness and response strategies. Thank you for watching our demonstration."
